# Here's some background information to get you going

**Running/ executing a command** tells the computer to follow the instructions.

The **console** is where commands are automatically executed by the computer.

Your **script editor** allows for your code to be reproducible and edit-able. Save the code to here run later. You can run code directly from the script editor in Rstudio too. Save files here the same way you do a word document. Rstudio is a script editor or IDE, also known as “interactive development environment.” You can type R code directly into the terminal on your computer, but Rstudio helps you to do it in an easy way. A little like wordpad vs. microsoft word. 

Your **Working Directory** is the place on your machine where the files you create are saved and the files you read from can be found (more on this later.

When coding in the terminal:
 > : green light, R is ready to accept commands.
 +: please say more. Enter more data because command is not complete yet. Press esc to exit and start over
  *Make a new folder for this exercise. Ex: ‘coding_tutorial’

For example:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

 
Note the 1 in brackets. That means that the output is a single value
 

```{r}
2 + 
```

*Write a complete command with addition, subtraction, or multiplication. Write an incomplete command and finish it on the second line
 
Annotation: You will want to make comments on your code. Use the hashtag before writing these. This will run:
 
        	> 2 + 2
> [1] 4
 
This will not produce an output.
 
 	> # 2 + 2
 
From now on, make comments on your code explaining what it does. You will thank yourself later when going back to the lesson.  
 
Example:
 	> # R can be used as a calculator
 	> 2 + 2
> [1] 4
 	> # The output is four
