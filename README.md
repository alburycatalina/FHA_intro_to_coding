# FHA: Introduction to coding

## This repo is for a 2 day introductory coding tutorial for Bahamian high school students at Forest Heights Academy. We will cover:

+ What coding is
+ What you can do with it
+ Some examples of coding commands and logic
+ “How to google”
+ What’s next?

This lesson is adapted from Data Carpentry’s [Intro to R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html). And uses data from [Dr. Aaron Macneil's](ifisheries.org/) Biologist's Toolkit course at Dalhousie University.

## Why learn to code?

You interact with technology everyday. Using Instagram, checking your email, watching youtube videos: all of these things require computers to work, which use code to tell them how to work. This code iss written by people just like you and me everyday. After today you might go on to program a website, make some digital art, process some data to understand your life better, or develop a game.

## Getting started

 Use this page to follow along with. We’ll be using the “sticky method” to make sure you and I are on the same page. We’ll work through the lesson in chunks. Put a blue sticky note on your computer if you’re finished the current task. Put a pink sticky note up if you need help.


## Setting Up
 
1. Start downloading the latest version of R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org) for Mac OS X or Windows. 
2. Download the Rstudio IDE [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
